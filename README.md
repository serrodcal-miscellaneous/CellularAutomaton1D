# CellularAutomaton1D

Python project to simulate one-dimensional binary cellular automaton for any rules. The initial condition is '0001000'.

The script needs two params: rule number in decimal and number of iterations:

	~$ python ca1d.py 30 100

## Rule 30

The rule 30 is a rule used to generate random number due to it generates chaos.

The output for this case is as given below:

	      █          
         ███         
        ██  █        
       ██ ████       
      ██  █   █      
     ██ ████ ███     
    ██  █    █  █
